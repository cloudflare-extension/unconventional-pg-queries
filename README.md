Unconventional Queries is a tiny query builder for the [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) library. Perfect for edge workers with size limits, such as [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits#worker-size), where every line of code counts. Unlock the utility of your Postgres DB, minimize bloat, and never write a line of SQL manually again!
